# VSCode

I already had VSCode installed so this step wasn't applicable for me.

# Remotely Connecting

1. The first step was opening VSCode, clicking Terminal at the top of the window, then clicking new terminal. After that, I typed ssh cs15lwi23abc@ieng6.ucsd.edu, where abc changes depending on a students username
2. Then it'll say the authenticity of the host can't be established and if you want to continue connecting, to which you should type yes
3. Then, type in your password after setting it using this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit)
4. You should then be connected!

# Trying Some Commmands

Try typing commands such as cd to enter a directory, ls to list out all the files in the current directory, cp to copy the files or directories in the current directory, and cat to print content of file onto standard output stream.
