# Grep Command with Various Options
The grep command is a powerful tool used to search for a specific pattern in a file or directory. It provides several options to perform different types of searches. In this section, we will discuss four options -c, -h, -l, and -o with their respective examples.

# 1. Option -c
The -c option is used to count the number of matches found in the file or directory.

Example 1: Count matches in a file
```
grep -c 'impose' ./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.md
```

This command counts the number of occurrences of the word "apple" in the fruits.txt file located in the written_2 directory.

Example 2: Count matches in all files
```
grep -c 'and' ./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/*
```

This command searches for the word "mango" in all files in the written_2 directory and counts the number of matches found in each file.

# 2. Option -h
The -h option is used to suppress the display of filenames when searching in multiple files.

Example 1: Search in a file without showing filename
```
grep -h 'impose' ./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.md
```

The text here was generated by ChatGPT. The prompt I used was: "Write the following in markdown language. For the grep command, the 4 options are -c, -h, -l, and -o. For each of those options, give 2 examples of using it on files and directories from ./written_2. Show each example as a code block that shows the command and its output, and write a sentence or two about what it’s doing and why it’s useful.

That makes 8 total examples, all focused on a single command. There should be two examples each for four different command-line options."
